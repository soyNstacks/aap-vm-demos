## Examples

All the variables defined in section [Role Variables](#role-variables) can be defined inside the ``vars.yml`` file.

Create a ``playbook.yml`` file like this:

```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: true

  tasks:
    - name: Provision a VM
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: cloud.vmware_ops.provision_vm
      vars:
        provision_vm_hostname: "test"
        provision_vm_username: "test"
        provision_vm_password: "test"
        provision_vm_validate_certs: false
        provision_vm_cluster: "DC0_C0"
        provision_vm_folder: "/DC0/vm"
        provision_vm_datacenter: "DC0"
        provision_vm_name: "vm-test"
        provision_vm_port: "8989"
        provision_vm_disk:
        - size_gb: 10
          type: thin
          datastore: "LocalDS_0"
        provision_vm_hardware:
          memory_mb: 512
          num_cpus: 4
        provision_vm_guest_id: "rhel9_64Guest"
```

Run the playbook:

```shell
