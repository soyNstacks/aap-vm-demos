## Role Variables

### Auth

- **info_hostname** (str, required)
    - The hostname or IP address of the vSphere vCenter.
    - If this variable is not set, the collection level variable `vmware_ops_hostname` will be used. If that variable is not set, the environment variable `VMWARE_HOST` will be used. At least one of these variables must be set to use this role.
    - See the [authentication documentation](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/blob/main/docs/authentication.md) for examples.

- **info_username** (str, required)
    - The vSphere vCenter username.
    - If this variable is not set, the collection level variable `vmware_ops_username` will be used. If that variable is not set, the environment variable `VMWARE_USER` will be used. At least one of these variables must be set to use this role.
    - See the [authentication documentation](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/blob/main/docs/authentication.md) for examples.

- **info_password** (str, required)
    - The vSphere vCenter password.
    - If this variable is not set, the collection level variable `vmware_ops_password` will be used. If that variable is not set, the environment variable `VMWARE_PASSWORD` will be used. At least one of these variables must be set to use this role.
    - See the [authentication documentation](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/blob/main/docs/authentication.md) for examples.

- **info_validate_certs** (bool)
    - Allows connection when SSL certificates are not valid. Set to false when certificates are not trusted.
    - If this variable is not set, the collection level variable `vmware_ops_validate_certs` will be used. If that variable is not set, the environment variable `VMWARE_VALIDATE_CERTS` will be used.
    - See the [authentication documentation](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/blob/main/docs/authentication.md) for examples.

- **info_port** (int or str)
    - The port used to authenticate to the vSphere vCenter that contains the cluster to configure.
    - If this variable is not set, the collection level variable `vmware_ops_port` will be used. If that variable is not set, the environment variable `VMWARE_PORT` will be used.
    - See the [authentication documentation](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/blob/main/docs/authentication.md) for examples.

### Output
- **info_expose_outputs_as_variable** (bool)
    - If set to true, the role will expose the gathered information as a variable which can be used later on in your playbook. The variable is called `vmware_ops_info_outputs`. If set to false, this variable is not set.
    - The variable and its attributes (license, appliance, etc) are returned regardless if data was gathered or not. However, if you do not gather information pertaining to an attribute an empty data set is returned.
    - The empty data set will be the same type as a populated dataset; meaning if the data set is normally a list, an empty list will be returned.
    - For example, if `info_appliance` is set to `false`, then `vmware_ops_info_outputs.appliance` will be `{}`. If `info_guests` is set to `false`, then `vmware_ops_info_outputs.guests` will be `[]`.

The variable's attributes have the following data types:
```yaml
vmware_ops_info_outputs:
  appliance: dict
  license: list(str)
  cluster: list(dict)
  guest: list(dict)
  storage: list(dict)
```
