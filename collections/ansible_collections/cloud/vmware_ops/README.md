# Ansible Collection: cloud.vmware_ops

This repository hosts the `cloud.vmware_ops` validated Ansible Collection.

The collection includes a variety of Ansible roles and playbooks to help automate the management of VMware.

It focuses on playbooks and roles that allow users to quickly and easily perform VMware operations tasks. The playbooks cover common use cases and leverage the roles inside the collection. The roles can be used to create your own playbooks and cover custom use cases for your environment.

## Requirements

This repository comes with an execution environment definition. This can be used to quickly build a container image that contains all of the software required to run the playbooks and roles in this repository. See [execution-environment/README.md](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/tree/main/execution-environment/README.md) for more information.

### Python Requirements

It is common for people to use `localhost` to run the tasks in this content since most tasks simply interact with the vSphere environment. If you do not use the execution environment mentioned above, the following requirements are needed on whatever host runs the tasks:
  - Python 3.9 or greater
  - Python requirements found in [execution-environment/requirements.txt](https://github.com/redhat-cop/cloud.vmware_ops/tree/main/execution-environment/requirements.txt)

Once the collection is installed, you can install the python requirements using pip: `pip install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/cloud/vmware_ops/execution-environment/requirements.txt`

### vSphere compatibility

This collection supports vSphere 7.x and 8.x.

### Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.15.0**.


## Installation and Usage

### Galaxy Requirements

Required collections are listed in the `galaxy.yml` and will be installed automatically when this collection is installed.

### Installation

This content can be installed from git by anyone with access to the repository.

To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, please ensure that you add the following lines to your ansible.cfg file.

```
# if you have multiple server configurations (validated content, certified content, public content, etc) you can specify those config
# section names here as a comma separated list. For example 'server_list = validated,public,my_galaxy
[galaxy]
server_list = validated

[galaxy_server.validated]
url=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/validated/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```
The token can be obtained from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

Once the above steps are done, you can run the following command to install the collection.

```
ansible-galaxy collection install cloud.vmware_ops
```

### Using this collection

Once installed, you can reference the cloud.vmware_ops collection content by its fully qualified collection name (FQCN), for example:

```yaml
  - hosts: localhost
    roles:
      - role: cloud.vmware_ops.system_settings
```
